#SignUp Page
Signup page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The page has a glassmorphism style, which means it uses transparencies, blurs, and light borders to create a frosted glass effect on UI elements. The page works well on colorful backgrounds that highlight the glass properties. 

To use this page, you need to have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You also need to include the following files in your project folder:

- index.html: This is the main file that contains the HTML structure of the signup page.
- app.css: This is the file that contains the CSS styles for the signup page, including the glassmorphism effect.

You can customize the page according to your preferences by changing the values of some variables in the style.css file. For example, you can change the colors, fonts, images, and messages of the page.
